  **The SDMX Istat Toolkit (SDMX-IT)** is a set of pick-and-choose, free and open-source, software building blocks allowing a statistical organization to facilitate the dissemination/reporting processes, through the standardization and industrialization of the following actions:
   metadata handling
	database building
	data loading
	data/metadata dissemination/reporting (GUI and M2M)
	data exchange between Organizations (Pull and Push)
The SDMX-IT was built using the SDMX Common API (SdmxSource.NET) and integrates the SDMX Reference Infrastructure (SDMX-RI) developed by Eurostat.
A statistical organization can use the Toolkit for building “stand-alone” dissemination systems or a “distributed” data warehouse SDMX-based.
